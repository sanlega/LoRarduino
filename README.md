# ARDUINO LoRa test:
To send messages between two Arduino Nanos using LoRa-02 SX1278 modules, you'll need to connect the modules to the Arduinos and set up the necessary software libraries. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Gather the required components:
   - 2x Arduino Nano
   - 2x LoRa-02 SX1278 module
   - Jumper wires
   - Breadboards (optional, but helpful for prototyping)

2. Connect the modules to the Arduino Nanos:
   Wire the modules to the corresponding Arduino pins, following the connections below:

   LoRa-02 SX1278 | Arduino Nano
   ---------------|--------------
   VCC            | 3.3V
   GND            | GND
   MISO           | D12
   MOSI           | D11
   SCK            | D13
   NSS            | D10
   DIO0           | D2
   RESET          | D9

   Repeat the connections for the second Arduino Nano and LoRa module.

3. Install the necessary Arduino libraries:
   You'll need to install the "LoRa" library by Sandeep Mistry. Open the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries, search for "LoRa" and install the library by Sandeep Mistry.

4. Set up the transmitter (Arduino Nano 1):
   Upload the transmitter.cpp code to the first arduino.
   
5. Set up the receiver (Arduino Nano 2):
   Upload the receiver.cpp code to the second arduino.
   
6. Test the communication:
   Power both Arduino Nanos and open their respective Serial Monitors. The transmitter should display "Sending packet: Hello world!" every 5 seconds, while the receiver should display the received message and the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) value.

You should now have a basic communication setup between two Arduino Nanos using LoRa-02 SX1278 modules. You can further customize the code to send and receive different types of data or implement additional features, such as error correction or encryption.
